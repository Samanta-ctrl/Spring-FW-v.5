/*	we can't use @Autowire without @Component. Because Component annotation is used to create bean, 
so if we not create bean then how can we inject with @Autowire.  

 	Suppose if you create more than one bean ,then it will be same type and for that ambiguity will happens. To overcome
 	this situation we have to use @Qualifiers with the default bean name of that class. 
 	
*/

/* 	when spring scans this package it will find this class @Component, 
	it will automatically register this bean with the spring container and 
they will use the bean ID. */

/*
	@Component: 
		Indicates that an annotated class is a “component”. 
	Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based 
	configuration and classpath scanning.
	
	--> @Component annotation marks the Java class as a bean or component 
	so that the component-scanning mechanism of Spring can add it into the application context.

/*
	@Autowired: 

	Spring @Autowired annotation is used for automatic injection of beans. 
Spring @Qualifier annotation is used in conjunction with Autowired to avoid confusion when we have 
two of more bean configured for same type. This would eliminate the use of XML configurations.

/*
	@PreDestroy and @PostConstruct:

 	These are alternative way for bean initMethod and destroyMethod. 
It can be used when the bean class is defined by us.

/*
	@Qualifier:

	There may be scenarios when you create more than one bean of the same type and want to wire 
	only one of them with a property. Control this using @Qualifier annotation along with the @Autowired annotation.
*/


/*
We use @Qualifier along with @Autowired to provide the bean id or bean name we want to use in ambiguous situations.

/*
	@Scope:
	
	We use @Scope to define the scope of a @Component class or a @Bean definition.
It can be either singleton, prototype, request, session, globalSession or some custom scope.
